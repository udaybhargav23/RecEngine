By increasing the surface area and porosity of the material, it becomes much more capable of binding to and absorbing an impressive array of liquids and gases. The Supercool Charcoal Soap for Deep Cleansing is inspired by an old Ayurvedic skin cleansing therapy. The active ingredient in this bar, activated charcoal, has a wide range of applications for detoxifying your skin, being an excellent promoter of healthy skin.
